excerpt: "EPEW is an annual event on all aspects of performance modelling and analysis."
---

The concept of performance in EPEW 2024 is considered in its broadest sense including the notions of Quality of Service, scalability as well as reliability, availability and systems management, among the others. Therefore, of particular interest are the ideas introducing new methods for evaluating complex systems, as well as innovative applications of methodologies and known techniques to the latest generation of systems, networks and computer-based services. 

EPEW 2025 seeks papers based on performance evaluation of systems from theoretical and practical viewpoint. Application of performance evaluation techniques to emerging technologies, like cyber-physical systems ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT), fog and edge computing, applications to large-scale cloud computing systems, smart grids, security infrastructures, are among the topics of interest to EPEW 2025.

## Program (TBD)


## Keynote (TBD)


## Scope and topics

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following topic areas:

Theoretical advances in performance modeling and evaluation:

  - Probabilistic, stochastic, or performability models, such as Queueing Networks, Petri Nets, and Process Calculi;
  - Specification of quantitative properties,
  - Analytical and numerical solution techniques and simulation techniques,
  - Quantitative model checking, equivalence checking, and static analysis
  - Context-aware modelling and analysis techniques
  - Machine learning and deep learning-based approaches for performance evaluation and analysis
  - Multiformalism and Multiparadigm modelling approaches

System, software, and network performance engineering:

  - Performance-oriented design, architecture, implementation, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
  - Constraint-based and model-driven system design
  - Performance analysis, simulation, and experimental design
  - Benchmark design and benchmark-based evaluation and monitoring
  - Automated interpretation of analysis results
  - Quality of service, and trade-offs between security, performance, dependability, energy consumption, usability, etc.
  - Software performance modeling languages, model composition and tool interoperability
  - 6G and beyond

Case studies:

  - Cloud systems, Hybrid Cloud, and Fog Computing Internet of Things
  - Cyber-physical systems
  - E-health systems
  - Blockchain and Cryptocurrency applications
  - Sharing services such as carshare and rideshare
  - Electric vehicles and battery modelling
  - Large-scale systems and scalability analysis of systems, robustness analysis of systems, resilience analysis of systems
  - Industrial case studies, experience reports and tools, with a solid analysis and theoretical background


## Submissions

EPEW 2025 features __post-proceedings__, with a two-phase review process:
- Authors are solicited to submit __short papers__ of at most __7 pages__ for presentation at the workshop. Accepted short papers will not be published in the proceedings.
- Authors of accepted short papers will be invited to submit __full papers__ of at most __15 pages__ (i.e., an extended version of the short paper) for publication in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series by Springer.

All page limits include tables, figures, and references. All papers must be submitted electronically (in PDF format) in __Springer’s LNCS__ format using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=epew2025).

Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. Authors should consult Springer's authors' guidelines and use Springer's LaTeX templates for the preparation of their papers. Submitted papers not complying with the above guidelines may be rejected without undergoing review.

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee based on technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.
