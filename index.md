excerpt: "EPEW is an annual event on all aspects of performance modelling and analysis."
---

The concept of performance in EPEW 2025 is considered in its broadest sense including the notions of Quality of Service, scalability as well as reliability, availability and systems management, among the others. Therefore, of particular interest are the ideas introducing new methods for evaluating complex systems, as well as innovative applications of methodologies and known techniques to the latest generation of systems, networks and computer-based services. 

EPEW 2025 seeks papers based on performance evaluation of systems from a theoretical and practical viewpoint. Application of performance evaluation techniques to emerging technologies, like cyber-physical systems ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT), fog and edge computing, applications to large-scale cloud computing systems, smart grids, security infrastructures, are among the topics of interest to EPEW 2025.

__Title__

Analyzing Energy Systems with Agent-Based and Data-Centric Distributed Simulation

__Abstract__

Energy systems are getting more complex by the integration of decentralized renewable generation, electric storages, flexible loads, multiple energy carriers, sector-coupling, and control by IT systems. Simulation is needed at all levels for understanding, planning, and optimized operation. We have provided two open-source simulation frameworks with this goal. First, we present i7-AnyEnergy as a library using the agent-based paradigm of AnyLogic, enhanced by the cellular approach and object-oriented programming concepts such as the dependency injection pattern so that “rapid modeling” is possible. It is illustrated by examples from industrial, public, and student projects: a cement plant enriched with a wind turbine and a battery, residential buildings with different heating options (such a gas or heat pump), and a sector-coupled energy system at the regional level. In all cases relevant KPIs such as costs and emissions can be provided. Second, we present Data-Centric Distributed Simulation (daceDS) as a framework for cross-domain and multi-level simulation necessary in more complex settings, as for instance in the NFDI4Energy project. It uses a domain-level taxonomy and topic-based publish-subscribe messaging for a loose coupling of simulation processes. We will present an example in which simulations from mobility and electric network domains can be coupled. We will then outline ongoing efforts to integrate AI-based control.
