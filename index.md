excerpt: "EPEW is an annual event on all aspects of performance modelling and analysis."
---

The concept of performance in EPEW 2025 is considered in its broadest sense including the notions of Quality of Service, scalability as well as reliability, availability and systems management, among the others. Therefore, of particular interest are the ideas introducing new methods for evaluating complex systems, as well as innovative applications of methodologies and known techniques to the latest generation of systems, networks and computer-based services. 

EPEW 2025 seeks papers based on performance evaluation of systems from a theoretical and practical viewpoint. Application of performance evaluation techniques to emerging technologies, like cyber-physical systems ranging from mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT), fog and edge computing, applications to large-scale cloud computing systems, smart grids, security infrastructures, are among the topics of interest to EPEW 2025.

__Title__

Analyzing Energy Systems with Agent-Based and Data-Centric Distributed Simulation

__Abstract__

Energy systems are getting more complex by the integration of decentralized renewable generation, electric storages, flexible loads, multiple energy carriers, sector-coupling, and control by IT systems. Simulation is needed at all levels for understanding, planning, and optimized operation. We have provided two open-source simulation frameworks with this goal. First, we present i7-AnyEnergy as a library using the agent-based paradigm of AnyLogic, enhanced by the cellular approach and object-oriented programming concepts such as the dependency injection pattern so that “rapid modeling” is possible. It is illustrated by examples from industrial, public, and student projects: a cement plant enriched with a wind turbine and a battery, residential buildings with different heating options (such a gas or heat pump), and a sector-coupled energy system at the regional level. In all cases relevant KPIs such as costs and emissions can be provided. Second, we present Data-Centric Distributed Simulation (daceDS) as a framework for cross-domain and multi-level simulation necessary in more complex settings, as for instance in the NFDI4Energy project. It uses a domain-level taxonomy and topic-based publish-subscribe messaging for a loose coupling of simulation processes. We will present an example in which simulations from mobility and electric network domains can be coupled. We will then outline ongoing efforts to integrate AI-based control.

__Bio__

Reinhard German received his PhD degree from Computer Science Department, TU Berlin, Germany in 1994. He is a Full Professor at the Computer Networks Lab in the Department of Computer Science, FAU, Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. He is also conducting research at the Energie Campus Nürnberg. From 2020 to 2024 he was an Adjunct Professor at the group of Sustainable Energy Systems of Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. His research interests include performance and dependability analysis of interconnected systems based on numerical analysis, network calculus, discrete-event simulation, and measurements. Satellite communications, vehicular communications and smart energy constitute major application domains.

### Submissions

EPEW 2025 features __post-proceedings__, with a two-phase review process:
- Authors are solicited to submit __short papers__ of at most __7-10 pages__ for presentation at the workshop. Accepted short papers will not be published in the proceedings.
- Authors of accepted short papers will be invited to submit __full papers__ of at most __15 pages__ (i.e., an extended version of the short paper) for publication in the post-proceedings.

All page limits include tables, figures, and references. All papers must be submitted electronically in __Springer’s LNCS format__ (in PDF format) using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=epew2025).

Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. Authors should consult Springer's authors' guidelines and use Springer's LaTeX templates for the preparation of their papers. Submitted papers not complying with the above guidelines may be rejected without undergoing review.

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee based on technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.
