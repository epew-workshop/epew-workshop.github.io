excerpt: "QUALIFIER is a ECSA workshop on the quality of software architectures."
---

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.
On the basis of such specification, it is possible to infer quality aspects of the software to be built, like performance, reliability, and maintainability.
In fact, software architectures provide a valuable opportunity to assess and drive software quality from the early stages of software development, as well as later on, during software evolution.

The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners both from the software architecture and the wider software engineering communities to collaborate, share experiences, provide directions for future research, and to encourage the use of quality assessment techniques in any stage of the software engineering lifecycle. 


## Call for paper

##### Themes and goals

Software architecture is a high-level abstraction of the system that, in stage-gate software development processes, provides a blueprint and directs implementation, balances various and potentially conflicting stakeholder concerns, and is influenced by high-level product requirements and business goals. For these reasons, software architectures must be of "high quality" due to their function. Quality itself is a broad concept with several meanings. For example, maintenance and performance are two quality properties that cover two distinct but related aspects of the same architecture. Therefore, we foster connecting researchers and practitioners to exchange knowledge on quality estimation in software architectures. Real-world contexts could benefit from the usage of software architectures, which in-turn could ease quality analysis of complex software systems.

##### Topics include, but are not limited to

 - Quantifiable models and metrics for SA quality
 - Interplay and trade-offs among quality properties
 - Refactoring and evolution of SA for quality
 - Automated optimization of SA with respect to quality properties
 - Quality of learning-based SA
 - Requirements engineering for SA quality assurance
 - Graphical visualization of quality properties of SA
 - User studies on quality aspects and quality assurance practices in SA
 - Datasets to benchmark quality assessment techniques for SA
 - Human-in-the-loop for the assessment and improvement of SA quality
 - Scalability and capacity planning 
 - Quality-driven cloud computing and edge-cloud architectures
 - Quality aspects in microservices-based architectures
 - AI/ML techniques for SA quality
 - Software architectures and human quality of experience
 - Quality attributes for the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems architectures
 - Quality-oriented industrial software systems (such as I4.0 and I5.0)
 - Any other topic related to quality in SA

##### Submission

QUALIFIER 2023 seeks contributions in the form of:
- 12 pages for full research papers in LNCS format + 2 extra pages for references;
- 8 pages for short research papers in LNCS format + 2 extra pages for references.

All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee.
All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ecsa2023](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ecsa2023), by creating a new submission in the “[Workshop] QUALIFIER 2023” track.

After the workshop, we will organize post-proceedings of selected and extended papers of workshops that will be published in a Springer LNCS volume (16 to 18 pages).
Candidate papers for post-proceedings will be identified by the reviewers and the workshop chairs, based on the paper quality and its relevance to the workshop.
Workshop papers submitted for the post-proceedings will undergo an additional review cycle.
